            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ANSWER To the late REPRESENTATION OF THE Miniſters of LONDON.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Deſire not to make the breach wider betwixt the miniſtry and the Army, its an ill time to have the word and the ſword of the Lord to differ, when both ſhould helpe him againſt the mighty. That which is ſubtilly faſtned upon the Army and their Councells, to wit, that they are Jeſuited, I wiſh it were not applicable to all ſorts of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers in this age, who have too little of Jeſus and too much of the Jeſuite in their tranſactions, ſavouring too much of calumny and policy.</p>
            <p>Not to take up every thing, but to touch upon thoſe that are of moſt weight and concernment in this <hi>Repreſentative,</hi> which comming from a Colledge of Divines, may therefore carry credite to the diſcrediting the good work in hand, of ſettling the Kingdome in ſafety and peace, hitherto ſo vainly promiſed and contrarily indeavoured, that the hearts and hands of thoſe concerned in it, and by it, may be upheld, and the Kingdome no more rendered miſerable, with vaine hopes, nor peace impoſſible, which were a work worthy of a Jeſuite indeed.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:117387:3"/>
            <p>Theſe <hi>London</hi> Miniſters firſt relate upon what termes they would have conſented to a conference, and tell us what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions they would have delivered on the caſe, it ſeems what reaſons ſoever might appeare to the contrary, for a confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſuppoſed, the reſult is concluſive, that the Armies <hi>courſes are unwarrantable,</hi> pag. 2. <hi>againſt the direct rule of the word,</hi> and <hi>as they conceive, out of their ſphere,</hi> p. 3. wherein they ſpeak as if never any thing had been or could be ſpoken in the Armies juſtification, where as ſuch reaſons have been already given, and ſuch authorities ſhown, both humane and divin, in trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes to that purpoſe, that are not ſatisfyingly refelled with bare affections, though from never ſo many; nor never ſo worthy men, whoſe disjunctions from the Army are not of yeſterday, procured indeed by the Armies unadviſed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments upon their calling, and ſome diſparagements caſt thereupon, which were juſt provocations, but not to be had in everlaſting remembrance, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.20 ſpecially when the publicke peace is concerned in their love and union.</p>
            <p>Then they reckon up the ſeverall late proceedings of the Army, againſt (as they ſay) lawfull authority, <hi>eſpecially by their Remonſtrance</hi> (a ſober, rationall, and convincing peece, not anſwerable by abrationall man, for I count Mr. <hi>William Sedgwicke</hi> none) <hi>impriſoning the King without conſent of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> (meaning the ſecluded Members) <hi>and the late unparaleld violence offered to the Members.</hi> Had theſe Divines condemned the <hi>Londoners,</hi> for impriſoning the Parliament (not ſome Members) making a priſon of the Parliament Houſe, and driving the Speaker &amp;c. thence; they might then with much more candor have blamed the Army now, but ſome may better ſteal a horſe then others looke over the hedge, if that was not a crime (as I never heard it laid to their charge) then this is no errour. <hi>Many of which Members</hi> they ſay, <hi>are known to be men of eminent worth and integrity, and have given ample teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of their reall affections to the good of this Kingdome.</hi> It had been well they had always continued of that mind; then had they been neither impriſoned nor hindred, but if they be ſo good, and beare ſo good affection to the publicke; they will take it the leſſe ill, to be hindred from doing ſo ill of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117387:3"/>as to hazzard the Kingdome in the hands of the King in freedome, honour, and ſafety, whoſe hands they could not bind by reſtraint. Next thing is, <hi>the Armies contriving of a new moddell of Lawes and Government, and the Repreſentative.</hi> Its much, ſuch men ſhould ſtumble at Reformation, onely for alteration ſake, as if old things, becauſe old, were faultleſſe; whereas our Lawes are (as they are made) our greateſt burdens, inſomuch as a man had as good take wrong, as ſeeke right, and our Government ſerving for lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle other then to furniſh the times with newes, by doing and undoing, toſſing the poore people between hopes and feares. Why may not alterations of Government bee as neceſſary in State as Church: Biſhops were too old to bee good, and ſo may many things elſe, and therefore not for that reaſon to be inſiſted on. <hi>All which practiſes they judge to be againſt Authority</hi> (ſo are Pulpits too when they are diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) <hi>Oathes and Covenants,</hi> though they are ſworn abſolutely to the ſafety and liberties of Religion, and the Kingdom and to the Parliam and King, but relatively and in order to theſe; So that theſe Divines ſhould either have forborne to cite thoſe words of the Covenant, as the Scots were wont to doe or have demonſtrated how Religion and Liberty could have been preſerved without taking theſe courſes: If they think the Treaty ſufficient, let them ſpeak out; and ſhew how a man of that <hi>perfidie</hi> and <hi>policy</hi> the King is off, could with ſafety to either, have been reſtored to freedome, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and ſafety, that notwithſtanding all bonds of Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and duty, hath from time to time thruſt at them, and hazzarded them, as he hath done: If we muſt have yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our ſelves to ſlavery and ruine, better have done it at firſt then at laſt, we ſhould have had more mercy then now we can look for. To let a Bear looſe from the ſtake with his chaine hanging on him, ſuch looſe reſtraint is the way to make him the more fierce; If the Army ſhould ſurceaſe, as they adviſe, the Members be reſtored, and peace ſetled, as was voted, and the King reſtored, (neither Epiſcopacy aboliſhed, nor Delinquents puniſhed) were the Covenant kept, and the Kingdome ſecured? Theſe Divines would
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117387:4"/>then be unſatisfied with themſelves, when by their means, ſuch horrid effects would follow, as would make both their ears to tingle, I would gladly know how the Army, into whoſe hands God hath put the power of prevention, could without breach of Covenant, have ſuffered all to goe to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine (which they are ſworn to preſerve) by preſerving thoſe things (King and Priviledges) which inavoydably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced thereunto, and were become inconſiſtent therewith. Beſides, their owne ſafeties, who elſe muſt alwayes have been fighting, or ſure of hanging: Beſides infinite honeſt men, who probably ere this had been crying woe worth the Parliament, if not theſe Divines themſelves, conſidering the party in the Kingdome, that waited for the Kings Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Honour, and Safety. Giving out, that what he gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in reſtraint, he might lawfully break at liberty.</p>
            <p>In the next place, page 4. are ſeverall Scriptures cited, which are all true in a Scripture ſenſe, but miſapplyed, like that in the frontiſe-peece, Prov. 24.11 <hi>If thou forbear to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them that are drawn unto death, and thoſe that are ready to bee ſlain.</hi> Such wreſtings of Scripture from Innocents to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, will make Miniſters in as bad a name as Lawyers.</p>
            <p>After the naming of which Scriptures, they ſay, <hi>they are afraid of medling with thoſe who without any colour of legall Authority ſhall attempt ſuch changes.</hi> We have had too much colourable authority, under the cloake whereof hath been acted ſo much wrong and injuſtice to the publike, and infinite particulars ſo that its high time to ſee it native, and naked. With what co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable Authority did the Divines in <hi>Scotland</hi> take part with the Minor againſt the Major part of the Parliament there, and proteſt againſt the Acts of Parliament, but becauſe they ſaw them fraudulent and deſtructive, notwithſtanding all the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Declarations of the Parliament to the contrary, and wherein doe the proceedings of the Army towards our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment differ from theirs; whoſe ſervice in protecting the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and inabling them againſt the Major was in <hi>Scotland</hi> counted a vertue, and commendable, and the ſelf-ſame thing in <hi>England,</hi> to the ſelf-ſame purpoſe counted a vice and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; How Doctors differ? Put caſe his Excellency the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> having power in his hands, ſhould have attempted to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:117387:4"/>have ſet up the King in freedome honour and ſafety, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of his Army ſhould have oppoſed it, knowing they were raiſed to a quite other end. I doubt not theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines would have thought well of and commended this their oppoſition to ſuch a deſign, though acted by thoſe under Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority againſt their chief Commander, without colour of Authority, only upon the equity of their intentions and juſtneſs of their cauſe. Such is the caſe of the Army towards the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, who not <hi>contrary to their truſt</hi> as is after aſſerted, but in diſcharge of their truſt and <hi>ingagements</hi> have againſt their wills taken theſe courſes, for though they were raiſed <hi>by the Parliament, yet for the Kingdome,</hi> and its ſafety, His Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies Commiſſion is the Card and Compaſſe that he muſt ſail by, and not be turned out of his courſe, by every wind of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary Doctrine, for ſo he ſhould not have been the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the Parliament, but of this or that Faction, and wrought about at laſt, by turning round, to fight for thoſe he was Commiſſioned to fight againſt, and againſt thoſe he was commiſſioned to fight for, well knowing that thoſe of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament which were againſt the Armies raiſing, were for its deſtroying, though with the ruine of the Kingdom and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the King, which was therefore laboured as the apteſt means for it.</p>
            <p>In the next place theſe Miniſters compare the Act of the King in relation to the five Members, and this of the Army, in relation to the Secluded Members together, <hi>page</hi> 5. A compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon ill beſeeming the candor of ſuch and ſo many worthy Divines, knowing the different Actors, and their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ends, they may as well compare the Execution <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nehas</hi> did, with the Murthers <hi>Joab</hi> committed, or <hi>Moſes</hi> his zeale, in ſlaying thoſe of the family of <hi>Ahab,</hi> for his own ends.</p>
            <p>Next they ſay <hi>p.</hi> 6. <hi>both Houſes of Parliament (who are joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly together with the King, intruſted with the ſupream Authority of the Kingdome)</hi> an obſervable Parentheſis at the latter end of a ſeven yeers war betwixt the King and Parliament, <hi>though they ſaw cauſe to take up Arms againſt the King, yet that does not juſtifie the Armie to uſurpe an authority over King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:117387:5"/>If either the defence of themſelves or the preſervation of the Kingdome, or both, juſtified the Parliament, then doe they alſo juſtifie the Army in what they do, for they have both thoſe apparently on their ſide; the Plots and practices of the King and ſecluded Members being above all things to level this Army, and ſo to make way for the Kings reſtoration, or the Kings reſtoration to ruine the army: The conſequence of which two is undiſputably the Kingdoms (I mean all the well-affected) deſtruction, and if defence be allowed to a private man in behalfe of himſelfe, it is much more allowable to a conſiderable community of men, lawfully put into arms in behalf of the whole whereof they themſelves are a part.</p>
            <p>In the next place they ſay <hi>page</hi> 7. <hi>the Parliament when they took up armes did not intend to diveſt the King of his authority, as appears by their Declarations, much leſſe to overthrow the frame of Government.</hi> The Parliaments chief intention was, according to their truſt, to preſerve the Lives and Liberties of the people, and that in an orderly and unaltered courſe, if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and therefore did they make ſo many ſupplications to the King to return to them, and rule by their advice according as he ought to doe, and accompanied them (the more to move him) with thoſe Declarations, all which hardned, in ſtead of ſoftned him towards them, and thereby thinking them to doubt their cauſe, and himſelfe to be unreſponſible: ſets up his ſtandard and commences firſt one War, proclaims them Traitors (the inſolenteſt and treaſonableſt act that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was committed by a King of <hi>England</hi>) yet they offer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and again, to be friends upon conditions of peace and ſafety tendred, he refuſes and will have no friendſhip but upon his own terms, ſo ended the firſt war, by a defeat of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes and reſtraint of his Perſon; and then began a ſecond, after which never iſſued out any more of thoſe Declarations ſpoken of, but ſeeing him incorrigible, they reſolve in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their truſt and diſcharge of their Conſciences to the Publique weale, to ſettle the Peace of the Kingdome without him, which they ſaw could never be ſetled with him:</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:117387:5"/>
            <p>In order whereunto they vote no more addreſſes, as a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary expedient thereunto, which upon a recruit of Lords, and ſecluded Members was unvoted again, and all new to ſeek, the King as bad as he was, and had been, muſt be truſted, and his own tearms granted, againſt Covenant, and Publick-Faith, to ground a Peace upon in order to his reſtoration, as the onely probable means to ruine the Army, by putting him into a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to raiſe another againſt them, an attempt of that nature having been put in practice at <hi>London,</hi> but not effected for want of the King, and thus is neceſſity brought home to our doors of doing what is done, both to the King and preſent govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by Lords, and ſecluded Members. Theſe things conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it ſhews how well they by this their Repreſentation, doe <hi>appear for maintenance of Liberties, as they ſay they doe againſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant deſignes of an arbitrary tyrannicall power in the King, and introduction of Anarchy by private perſons;</hi> but it is not enough to ſay ſo, it is not wiſe mens parts to cry up the ends, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry the means, how to ſuppreſſe tyranny, and not Tyrants is a hard leſſon. The moſt excellent Mathematicians are to ſeeke when they goe to Sea; Theory and Practiſe are two things, one may better make a <hi>

            <p>The next thing inſiſted on, is the obligation that lyes upon us by Oath and Covenant, <hi>Pag.</hi> 8. <hi>To preſerve the Rights and priviledges of Parliaments, the Kings Majeſties perſon and authority, in the preſervation and defence of the true Religion, and liberties of the Kingdome.</hi> This laſt conditionall clauſe, <hi>In preſervation of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:117387:6"/>and Liberties,</hi> is made to ſerve but as a cypher in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, the Scots Commiſſioners were wont to leave it out, the better to blinde the people, and cite the preceding part with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it: Theſe Divines do <hi>tant', amount,</hi> for though they cite them joyntly, yet they urge the other abſtractly, and as ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to this, never telling us how theſe may be provided for, in caſe the other ſhould not be granted, notwithſtanding the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent inconſiſtency of them both. For the King (in whom the preſent Government of Lords and ſecluded Members are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved, they voting a ſettlement upon his non-conceſſions, and refuſing that of non-addreſſes, and bringing him to juſtice; thereby to put a period to delayes) both in liberty and reſtraint, hath twice put Religion and Liberties to ſuch an hazard, as had not God miraculouſly preſerved them, they had periſhed irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverably, and we with them in lives and eſtates, and no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter can be expected from him, juſtifying his wayes now at his Triall, at laſt, as at firſt, labouring to confront, and not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, which is a mercy of God, that he retains his nature with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſſembling it, leſt the <hi>hypocrite ſhould reigne, and ſo the people be inſnared.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Oaths were never intended by maker or taker againſt the Laws and duty of God and Nature, which indeed no oaths can violate: The reaſon is rendred why we ſwore the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his perſon, to wit, to expreſſe <hi>our Loyalty,</hi> that thoſe wars were not undertaken upon any rebellious or perſonall purpoſes, but of neceſſity in reſpect of Religion and Liberty, upon the point to be utterly ſubverted, and that we were ready to lay downe Armes, and receive him with thoſe reſpects be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to him, whenſoever it did appear that thoſe might be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, which never did yet ſince thoſe oaths were taken, and therefore notwithſtanding them, the Parliament went on to fight him, to the juſt hazard of his perſon, and now judicially to proceed againſt him, as not otherwiſe able to diſcharge that great truſt that lyes upon them, touching the wellfare of this, and ſucceeding generations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 9. They ſay, <hi>They dare not by the violation of this oath provoke the wrath of God.</hi> But put caſe your advice ſhould be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:117387:6"/>followed as to the King and Parliament priviledges, dare you thereupon affirme the oath to be kept, if Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Liberties ſhould ſuffer, and the Kingdome be undone thereby, our Oath is not categoricall, but hypotheticall, ſo that if the keeping of the one part, be the breaking of the other (for ſo is our caſe) then the queſtion is, which muſt be kept, and which muſt be broken; whether to ſatisfie you we ſhould keep it on the Kings part, or to ſatisfie our own reaſon and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, we ſhould keep it on the Commonwealths part; and if in your ſenſe, it doe binde ſo ſtrictly for the Kings preſervation: why did you ſuffer war to be made upon him without like advice, wherein his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon might have periſhed, nay did periſh as to the oath, he running the like hazard with other men, without difference or diſtinction, ſo that rationally in the uſe of means (though not actually) his perſon was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, notwithſtanding the Parliament it ſelfe had ſworne to preſerve him, and no fault found.</p>
            <p>In the ſame Page, they dehort the Army from proceeding any further (I will not ſay a Jeſuit is in it) and tell them they <hi>were once Honourable with them and others, whilſt they kept in Gods way, and within their ſphere</hi> (there lay their fault indeed) <hi>but they have eclipſed their own glory, &amp; brought a cloud over all their excellencies.</hi> It ſeems theſe Divine thinks the Country to be ſpirited towards the Army like the City: Indeed the Malignants and Newters thinke as hardly of them for this, as they can wiſh; but the godly and ſincere (I meane thoſe of no faction, and without byaſſe) who in conſcience to God, and with publicke ſpirits, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:117387:7"/>this cauſe for Religion, Liberty, and to bring Delinquents to condigne puniſhment; doe bleſſe them in the Name of the Lord in this, and for this, as a deliverance equall to the firſt or ſecond Warre, and are not a little afflicted in ſpirit to ſee you to bee become the rejoycing of the Cavaliers, and the lifter up of the heads of thoſe prophane wretches, in the day that God hath humbled them, and glorified himſelf upon them. God keep your own glory, and the Goſpell engaged in you, from being eclipſed, and your excellency from being beclouded in the wayes of contradiction that you are in, neither help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord, nor ſtrengthning them that doe. Be more ſenſible of the City ſins, over-looke not their faults that are under you, their defection and <hi>back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding from publicke principles, ſetting up the worſt men in the beſt places, preſsing the Parliament with clamorous, and menacing Petitions to deſtructive pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, impriſoning the whole Houſe in the Houſe, till they had voted the King to</hi> London, <hi>and threatning worſe things if they came againe, forcing away the Speaker, and the faithfulleſt Members, refuſing to aid their honeſt Major Generall againſt the common Enemy, though as it were at Townes end, and ſcoffing thoſe few that did, barely looking on, and worſe at the ſiege of</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter. Why then beholdeſt thou the more that is in thy brothers eye, but conſidereſt not the beame that is in thine owne eye: Are theſe and ſuch like veniall in your owne Pariſhioners, and mortall in the Army, judge with righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:117387:7"/>
            <p>The Miniſters goe on in the ſame Paragraph, and ſay, <hi>We feare you are opening a doore to deſperate and damnable Errours and Hereſies:</hi> Truely I doubt ſo too, but never the more for ſuppreſſing the King, and ſecluding the Members: one thing I am confident of, that it will not be a crime to be an honeſt man as it was heretofore, when the King was King, and would have been ſo, had he been ſo againe.</p>
            <p>Next they tell the Army, Pag. 10. <hi>What threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings are in Scripture againſt contemners of Magiſtrates, and judgements denounced on the oppoſers of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But they ſhould diſtinguiſh betwixt Magiſtrates and Magiſtracie, the one may be diſobeyed, and the other not contemned, nor oppoſed; the firſt being the Ordinance of man, the other of God, and who are meerely men, and not Magiſtrates in thoſe things wherein they prevaricate.</p>
            <p>I queſtion whether they did greater contempt in ſecluding the Members, or they that owne not the remainder (out of a ſullen humour) for the Houſe of Commons, which the Army doe with all reſpect, which ſhewes them not to bee againſt Magiſtracie, though againſt corrupted and ſeduced Magiſtrates, that by falſifying their truſt have juſtly forfeited it.</p>
            <p>But for to ſtrike the greater ſtroke, they afterwards vouch the terrible examples of <hi>Corah, Dathan and Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram, upon their mutiny againſt Moſes and Aaron,</hi> compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the act of theſe rake-hells who in ambition and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy againſt Gods faithfull Miniſters and Servants, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:117387:8"/>for their horour and preferment ſake, into thoſe offices wherein God himſelfe had ſet them, and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly confirmed them, mutinied againſt them, not for any miſcarriages of injuſtice, or impiety in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe their places, who no doubt might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully have oppoſed <hi>Aaron,</hi> when at <hi>Horeb</hi> hee made the golden Calfe, this act I ſay, they compare to the Armies ſecluding the noxious members (as will ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare to thoſe without, and which hath long been known to them within the walls of the Houſe of Commons) and the bringing the King to tryall in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Kingdomes ſettlement. It is wonderfull to ſee ſo looſe and unweighed a paſſage drop from the pen of ſo many learned Divines: But nothing is ſtrange in this age, but an <hi>Orthodox Independent,</hi> and a <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Patriot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Afterwards they proteſt againſt (pag. 11.) theſe practiſes of the Army <hi>in oppoſing Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and murthering the King</hi> (ſo they call their bringing him to juſtice) <hi>as concurrent with Jeſuiticall Principles,</hi> it is ſtrange that Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites ſhould bee of the plot againſt the King and Queen, they have deſerved better from them, and no doubt would have done had they been in power, or againſt the ſecluded Members, the beſt friends to Biſhops next to Cavaliers in armes. Ieſuits are not wont to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:117387:8"/>be ſo good Engliſh men as to go againſt the intereſt of Rome, nor to forſake their adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, a Son and Daughter of his holineſſe to ſtrike hands with another party. But doubtleſſe there is great difference betwixt murtherous maſſacring of Proteſtant Princes <hi>eo nomine,</hi> and juſt araignment of Delinquent Kings before the Senate and people. Had the Army killed the King in fight, would you have abhorred it as a murtherous act, <hi>under a ſpecious pretence?</hi> and is it more lawfull to kill him violently then judicially?</p>
            <p>Then in the ſame page they adviſe the Army to conſult themſelves (and ſo do you your ſelves of the affirmative) if <hi>ſome other party, whoſe principles had not been concurrent with theirs, ſhould have attempted the ſeizeing of the Kings perſon,</hi> how they would have conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and ſo for <hi>ſecuring and prohibiting the Members.</hi> If the party ment by non concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of principles be Cavaleriſh Londoners, doubtleſſe the Army would have thought ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ill of it, or for any to have done it, that had done it to thoſe publicke ends they doe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:117387:9"/>it for, fearing whioh, therefore they did it; knowing what deſire there was to ſet him at liberty to begin the warres againe, but if any confiding men would have eaſed them of this work for publick purpoſes, <hi>I</hi> dare anſwer for them, it would have been thankfully tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, as you ſaw it was when they ſo chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and humbly, ſeconded the votes of ſetl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peace without him, ſeeing it could not bee done with him.</p>
            <p>For ſecuring and inhibiting Members, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have done that as well as they, I meane the Citizens when they drive the Speaker, &amp;c. from the Parliament to the Army, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed reſtored him, without damnifying the City the worth of one gold chaine.</p>
            <p>Afterwards they compare againe the King and his wicked Inſtruments, <hi>ſubverſion of Lawes, and diſſolving Parliaments,</hi> with the Armies laudable indeavours of the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſettlement of the Kingdome, in its liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the people in their Rights, extorted from them by the King, and his Creatures, as eccleſiaſticall rights had of long time been by Biſhops.</p>

            <p>What the meaning is of thoſe words in the 12. Page: <hi>If through Gods permiſſion</hi> (for reaſons beſt knowne to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe) you have had, or may have ſucceſſe in an evill way, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I underſtand not, I hope it neither meanes their Victories a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King or Soots; and therefore they inferre <hi>Gods Provide nce is no ſafe Rule to walke by;</hi> and to confirme it, bring the example of <hi>Davids sparing Saul when he was in his hands.</hi> Providence is no Rule to juſtifie any thing that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Rule rightly underſtood; for there may be a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtanding of right Rules, according to that of Chriſt in behalfe of his Apoſtles accuſed of Sabbath breaking: <hi>Have yee not heard what David did when he was an hungry,</hi> to wit lawfully, which yet was unlawfull by the Rule: So when theſe Divines quote <hi>Davids</hi> Example towards <hi>Saul,</hi> they ſhould ſtate the caſe aright, not of <hi>David</hi> a private perſon, taking up Armes for his owne defence againſt <hi>Saul</hi> (marke that by the way) whom he was not to kill, that he might ſucceed him; upon which motive they incited him to doe it, but to ſtay Gods time, not to ſnatch the bleſſing like <hi>Jacob</hi> before it was ripe: I ſay they ſhould not put the caſe of ſuch a <hi>David,</hi> but they ſhould ſuppoſe him in Armes by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Magiſtracy, or people againſt <hi>Saul,</hi> declared a Violator of his Truſt, and Iſraels juſt Liberties, as the King hath been by Parliament, to ſuppreſſe his exorbitancies, and defend them againſt him; this is the <hi>David</hi> that runnes pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallell with our Army, and the caſe thus put, the queſtion is, what <hi>David</hi> would have done againſt <hi>Saul</hi> towards bringing him to juſtice, it providence had favoured him? Who it ſeemes though a private perſon, would forceably have defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himſelfe (as by taking Armes appeares) if he had beene put to it by Providence, for all the promiſe, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he relied upon to the uttermoſt extremity; but in extremity would not have tempted God by a faith without meanes: But as I ſay <hi>David</hi> was not to come by the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome by King-killing, that would have cut God ſhort of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Glory, and therefore he ſaith, <hi>The Lord forbid that I</hi> (to wit a private perſon, and <hi>Sauls</hi> Succeſſor) <hi>ſhould
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:117387:10"/>do this thing unto my Maſter, the Lords Anoynted;</hi> that I a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant and ſubject ſhould for mine own ends and ambition, take away the life of the King, who is anoynted and appoynted by God to Reigne out his time, notwithſtanding the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to me of the Kingdome after him: Soe I may come to loſe it, which if I waite Gods leiſure, I ſhall be ſure of in Gods good time: But where doe theſe Divines finde that when a wicked King of Iſrael was by the Magiſtrates or people for his owne wickedneſſe and publique good, taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way (though they alſo were the Lords Anoynted) that ever they were blamed for it? I am ſure neither for <hi>Athaliah,</hi> nor <hi>Amaziah.</hi> nor I doe not remember any elſe; though I know many private perſons are condemned for doing ſo for baſe and unwarrantable ends.</p>
            <p>And as not by Providence, ſo nor is it ſafe they ſay to be <hi>guided by impulſes of spirit againſt the Rule,</hi> to wit rightly underſtood; and they deſire the Army to conſider whether if there be upon Record any <hi>example of an impulſe of spirit upon multitudes of perſons, putting them to act againſt morall Precepts:</hi> When the Iſraelites ſaved <hi>Jonathan</hi> againſt their owne Vow, and the Authority of <hi>Saul,</hi> this ſeemes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like one; but whether it will be allowed, I know not: when the Londoners told the Parliament they muſt take ſuch courſes as God and Nature put into their hands: What call you this, and were they blamed for it? Then by the way upon occaſion, Page 14. They tell the Army, they themſelves confeſſe their wayes to be <hi>irregular, and not juſtifiable,</hi> wherein the Armies ingenuity is commendable, and their Cauſe never the worſe; for a thing may be irregular, and not juſtifiable by the Letter of the Law, and formallity of Rule, that yet is lawfull enough. Have yee not read in the Law, how on the Sabbath dayes the Prieſts in the Temple <hi>prophane</hi> the Sabbath, and are <hi>blameleſſe?</hi> Politicks and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicialls muſt yeeld to moralls, municipall Lawes to Religion and ſafety: Order is good till it become diſorderly, and then <hi>corruptio optimi eſt peſſima,</hi> no ſuch oppreſſion as Authority corrupted and abuſed, when Government is poynted at the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:117387:10"/>Governours, and not at the governed, driving ſiniſter intereſts by vertue of their Offices, neither fearing God, nor hating covetouſneſſe. In matters of reall publique concernment, as to Politicks, God will have mercy and not ſacrifice, ſafety preferred above Formes, and Lawes of Nature above thoſe of Art and Pollicy.</p>
            <p>But then it followes, that <hi>no neceſſity can oblige a man to ſinne,</hi> but when by vertue of neceſſity it becomes lawfull, then it is no ſinne; as in the foregoing inſtances of <hi>Davids</hi> eating the ſhewbread, and the Prieſts prophaning the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath: neceſſity juſtified our partaking with the <hi>minor</hi> againſt the <hi>major</hi> in Scotland, which yet was breach of priviledge.</p>
            <p>Further, Pag. 15. they ſay, that if <hi>a Precept of God may be diſpenced upon a neceſſity, yet it muſt be abſolute, preſent, and cleare, not doubtfull, uncertaine, and conjecturall, as that which is aledged in your caſe muſt needs be, it being diſcerned only by your ſelves, and your owne party; it being apparent to us that there was no neceſſity, the Parliament (till forced by you) being full and free, acting what was covenanted for.</hi> Doe they meane by <hi>abſolute</hi> neceſſity, that the Scots muſt be come as far as Lancaſhire before we ought to beleeve they will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade us? or that Wales, Kent, with the adjacent parts, and the ſhips at ſea muſt Rebell actually, and revolt declaratively before we ought to beleeve that the King (when in reſtraint) can do us any harme; when they ſay it muſt be <hi>preſent,</hi> mean they it muſt be Acted before it be prevented; in matters of war and buſineſſe of State, if they ſtay for preſent and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity, it is the way to be deprived of remedy. Though <hi>David</hi> was hungry and the Apoſtles, when the one eate the ſhewbread, and the other rubbed the eares of corne, yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them probably was upon the point of famiſhing, their neceſſity was not abſolute. Shall the Army never be allowed to be wiſe, onely valiant, ſtill put to play after games, and God to worke miracles by our imprudence; know wee not yet what manner of men we deale with? hath not the King, and his Parliamentary complices yet made neceſſity cleare? There are none but you and your party (as you ſay by
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:117387:11"/>the Army) that thinks otherwiſe but what they meane by the Army, and their Party is as little intelligable as are theſe three foreſaid properties of neceſſity: do they meane by party the Parliament now ſitting, of whom this Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation takes no notice, or doe they meane the unbiaſſed godly and true hearted Patriots in the Land, for I thinke their party goes no further? The <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Members,</hi> the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers,</hi> and <hi>Londoners,</hi> being indeed no Partizans of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, nor competent Judges of the Kingdomes neceſſity, which is abſolute enough if thereby bee meant important. Theſe Divines themſelves looking with London ſpectacles, ſay, <hi>they ſaw none:</hi> its well for you you did not, and its as well that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did, ſince youl admit of no neceſſity to be cleere, but whats <hi>abſolute</hi> and <hi>preſent,</hi> thats as much as to ſay you will never ſee till your eyes be out. I am confident had our State or Army ſeazed on <hi>Barwicke</hi> and <hi>Carlile,</hi> and pleaded neceſſity for it before the Cavaleers and Scots were poſſeſſed of them, you would have condemned it as neither <hi>abſolute,</hi> nor <hi>preſent,</hi> and ſo a cleere breach of agreement; notwithſtanding the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertures of invaſion made in Scotland by preparations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. Nor doubtleſſe did you ſee any prevaricating in the Scotch Commiſſioners when they were in England, but thought it a meere <hi>Artifice</hi> to ſuſpect them, in ſo much as I have ſeene a booke licenſed by — that ſaies <hi>their memory was ſweet for their keeping Covenant,</hi> when to others they ſtunke above ground for breaking it. Nor did you ſee a need of the Armies refuſing to disband, it may be that's it you meane when you ſay this <hi>neceſſity pleaded is contracted by their owne miſcarriages:</hi> if you do meane ſo, there are not many out of London of your minde, except ſome that came from thence and thereabouts; for it is abſolutely uncleare to others that are not of the Kings party, that the disbanding of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my is the ſecuring of the Kingdome.

            <p>They ſay there was no neceſſity, the Parliament being free <hi>(till forced by the Army)</hi> and not by the Londoners, and <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting what was Covenanted for;</hi> to wit, a ſettlement of the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:117387:11"/>Kingdomes Peace upon his Majeſties noncon-ceſſions of aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Biſhops, and bringing Delinquents to condigne pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment: Then they tell the Army they <hi>engaged themſelves by Oath to preſerve His Majeſtios perſon, and the Priviledges of Parliament;</hi> yea, and the liberties of the people too, but that's not here, and it ſeemes is not worth regarding, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the other two; for its apparent their advice tends to break this by keeping thoſe ſeverall intereſts at ſuch a diſtance, and contrariety being impoſſible to be preſerved; the very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the one being the deſtruction of the other. Now ſay they <hi>no neceſſity can juſtifie perjury, or dispence with lawfull Oathes,</hi> and for example inſtanceth the <hi>judgement which befell</hi> Saul <hi>and</hi> Iſraell <hi>for breach of Covenant with the Gibeonites:</hi> But the queſtion is if the Gibeonites had raiſed a firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond war, or taken parts and ſhared in Councels with the Cavaleriſh Canaanites their enemies, what then <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell</hi> would have done, or might have done for all their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. But to ſpenke a little to the Poſition it ſelfe, That <hi>no neceſſity can diſpence with Lawfull Oathes,</hi> not to inſiſt upon the forementioned Act of the Iſraelites in ſaving <hi>Jonathan,</hi> I anſwer two things. 1. That no Oath binds, when through want of foreſight, by time or accident it come to croſſe a morrall duty: as if that I am ſworne to prove, be againſt my owne, or the publicks preſervation, and ſo a violation of the Lawes of nature; nor if it prove an impediment to the <hi>proceed</hi> of juſtice, and ſo prove a violation of the Lawes of Righteouſneſſe. Nor if it prove (though Lawfull in itſelfe) a wrong to another, as that of <hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>Jonathan,</hi> for ſo it is againſt the Law of Charity. 2. That when the Oath becomes diſputable, then the intent of its giving, and the occaſion of its taking, is to give light in the ſolution.</p>
            <p>Now what was our intent in proteſting and covenanting the preſervation of the King? Why, to teſtifie to the World that it was for no ſiniſter end, nor to drive no deſigne, that the Wars were undertaken, no lack of Loyalty, but meere ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to preſerve the people, and their Liberties; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was the Wars proſecuted againſt the King, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
